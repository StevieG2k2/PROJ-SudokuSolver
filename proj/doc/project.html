<div>SudokuSolver is a comparison of sudoku solving algorithms that use strategies, ordered in different ways, and a backtracking algoritm.&nbsp;</div><div>The strategies are written based on the description from <a href="https://www.sudokuwiki.org/Getting_Started">SudokuWiki</a> and use a Pencil-and-Paper approach. This means each empty cell of the Sudoku board will store possible number candidates that can be the solution for that cell and the solving strategies will mostly eliminate candidates. <br></div><div>The backtracking algoritm was written based on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UYXzGuqvM">video</a> and moddified to our project structure.<br></div><div><br>
