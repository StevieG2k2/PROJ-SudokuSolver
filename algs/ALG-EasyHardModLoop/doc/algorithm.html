<div>Algorithm that uses a loop to call the solving method functions from easiest to hardest strategies, but upon successfull candidate elimination the loop continues into a new iteration. This makes it so if singles are made, they are all filled before the algorithm goes removing candidates using other methods. The filling functions of the algorithm are called more often which may result in faster solving times.<br></div>
