# SudokuSolver
This is the ALGator project of my thesis with the title: Speed and correctness of algorithms for solving sudoku puzzles.

Due to the size of some sudoku datasets they can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RLO1GQT2Yu0Q_FufYWVRXYy1LXJu-rUk/view?usp=sharing). To insert the datasets into the project just unzip the file in the "tests" folder.
